			<h2>Family</h2>
				<p>I come from a large family. I have two brothers, me being the oldest. I live with my mom and dad who are both teachers. Most of my family such as aunts, uncles, and cousins live nearby. I have 6 uncles and 5 aunts and many cousins. The more distant family members like second cousins or other uncles/aunts live in Mexico and we go to visit about every two years. My family give eachother visits often and celebrate holidays together. It is usually connected and together, thankfully.</p>
