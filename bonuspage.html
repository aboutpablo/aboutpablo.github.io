		<h1>Education</h1>
			<p>I believe education is very important. Everyone should be able to get an education regardless of where they live, their race, religion, or gender. Unfortunately, not everybody around the world is able to receive an education.</p>
			<h2>Importance of Education</h2>
			<p>In this world, knowledge is significant. Almost all jobs require some sort of education, whether it’s a high school diploma, or a Bachelor’s Degree. Getting a job with a good pay is needed to support a family, or to buy a house or a car. These jobs though, need a high level of education. Also, an education helps people make informed decisions throughout their lives.
